          The goal of this workshop is to introduce you to two widely used
          packages, Styled-Components and Toastify. At the end of this workshop
          your App should look something like the preview you have on your left.
          Feel free to use any of these packages in your third project,
          especially Toastify... Andr√© looooooves Toastify!
